## Designing An Intelligent Othello System Using Turn-based Partitioning

#### Abstract
In this paper, the theory behind designing an advanced AI to play the 2-player board game Othello is described and augmented. We begin by providing various bitboard techniques. Minimax Search is used as the foundation of our game tree search, and Alpha-beta pruning and move order selection are further added to increase efficiency. Search is cut off at a depth limit and evaluation functions are used to determine board utilities. The idea of turn-based partitioning is introduced as an improvement that can be applied to evaluation functions. Experimental results of incorporating turn-based partitioning show increases in win percentages against a benchmark opponent.
